Peggy
=====

_Peggy is a showcase system for fablabs / makerspaces_ 

> On the 5th of October 2016 the design collective [LibreObjet](http://libreobjet.org) publishes plans for a new piece of display furniture for Fablab/Maker-Hacker-spaces. Take up the fabbing gauntlet and make your own version!
> 
> What is done in a fablab often stays invisible for fellow users, the infrastructure is used but the results go elsewhere. We want to show the potential of what is possible with digital fabrication in the lab itself, and this is what the display unit is made for.
> 
> Every lab is different with regards to its infrastructure, machines, resources and availability of materials. A display made in a fablab in Dakar will not be the same as one made in Brussels. This diversity is exciting and by entering the challenge you can help highlight the richness of the fabber-maker-hacker universe and celebrate the manifold possibilities of open source object design.
